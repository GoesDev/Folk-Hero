# Folk Hero
**Folk Hero** is a text-based RPG. It's my first side-project in Python after some months of study.

### About the Game
In **Folk Hero**, you create a character from one of the available classes: **Warrior**, **Cleric**, **Thief**, and **Mage**. Your hero starts at level 1 with 10 life points, and has Power and Defense stats that are randomly distributed. Your mission is to explore a dungeon, killing enemies along the way. In the last room, a Boss awaits you.

### What did I learn? 
First of all, programming is fun! Hard? Yes, but extremely rewarding.
I tried to write all the code in this program by myself, and sometimes looking at the Python documentation. I didn't have too many difficulties with OOP as I had imagined.

I did my best to organize the directories and structure of the program. I admit that some things could be better, but there came a point where I just wanted to finish it XD.

English isn't my first language, so I apologize for any typing or grammatical errors. I hope you understood the project, and I appreciate you taking the time to visit it!
